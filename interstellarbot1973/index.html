<h3>Interstellar Bot 1973 is a bot that simulates the voyage of an exploratory spaceship. The bot runs in real-time, rolling the chance for an encounter to occur every minute, and posting a report of what encounters have occurred to Facebook every hour.</h3>

<h4 style = "font-size:13px;font-weight:normal">Encounters will have various effects on each of the ship's systems and resources, and as time progresses the 'story' of the ship will too. While there is no scripted story that is followed, notable encounters are recorded and can be accessed via the supplemental Discord Bot, as can a report on the status of the vessel.</h4>
